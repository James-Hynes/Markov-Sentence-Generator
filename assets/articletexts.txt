in

intention
is
not
a

rather
a

approach
that
limits

and
has
the
backing
of
empirical
studies
on
restricting
the

the

what

was
that

anger

the

of

the

to
view
themselves
as

rather
than
as
a

high

in
the
view
themselves
as

the

of
the
silent

out
in

sickening

the

the

of
the

serves
as
a
reminder
that
rather
than
an
isolated

the
case
was
symptomatic
of
a
force
that
regularly
arrested
people
for
insufficient
reasons
or
no

and
used
excessive

of
millions
of

to

applauds
the

current
for

of
the
more
striking
elements
of
the
report
is
that
theres
little
disagreement
about
the
dire
straits
in
everyone
who
spoke
to
current
and
former
leaders
officers
and
command
staff
during

interviews
community
members
throughout
the
many
neighborhoods
of

representatives
of
all
levels
of
officers
in
advocacy
groups
and
civic
and
religious
that
has
significant
problems
that
have
undermined
its
efforts
to
police
constitutionally
and
effectively
the
report
and
other
leaders
have
noted
that
police
are
often
asked
to
grapple
with
problems
they
are
neither
hired
nor
equipped
to
answer
from
entrenched
poverty
to
crises
to
systemic
racism
report
does
not
stint
on
those
issues
including
for
example
a
history
of
redlining
it
also
makes
clear
this
does
not
excuse
violations
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
rights
of
the
people
living
in
these
challenging
conditions
law
enforcement
practices
at
times
exacerbate
the
longstanding
structural
inequalities
in
the
impossible
to
sum
up
the
breadth
of
the
report
succinctly
but
these
are
a
few
of
the
most
surprising
troubling
and
disturbing
findings
involve
not
only
racial
disparities
but
dismissive
attitudes
toward
sexual
assault
violence
against
the
mentally
ill
and
a
culture
of
retaliation
against
report
comes
down
hard
on
policing
a
variation
on
the
style
that
was
laid
out
in
a
article
and
was
until
relatively
recently
in
vogue
in
major
cities
around
the
in
at
least
the
late
s
however
and
leadership
responded
to
the
challenges
by
encouraging
zero
tolerance
street
enforcement
that
prioritized
officers
making
large
numbers
of
stops
searches
and
often
resorting
to
minimal
training
and
insufficient
oversight
from
supervisors
or
through
other
accountability
structures
practices
led
to
repeated
violations
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
rights
further
eroding
the
trust
in
the
frequently
arrested
people
for
minor
offenses
recent
city
and
department
leadership
have
rejected
that
policy
but
the
report
documents
how
that
message
hasnt
made
it
down
to
commanders
and
officers
on
the
supervisors
instruct
officers
to
make
frequent
stops
and
for
minor
offenses
and
with
minimal
or
no
sufficient
consideration
of
whether
this
enforcement
strategy
promotes
public
safety
and
community
trust
or
conforms
to
constitutional
of
stops
lack
the
reasonable
suspicion
required
to
justify
them
and
many
of
the
arrests
they
make
are
unconstitutional
either
lack
a
warrant
and
probable
cause
or
officers
failed
to
inform
people
they
were
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
many
cases
they
also
end
without
a
citation
or
arrest
evidence
of
the
flimsiness
of
many
arrests
comes
from
the
fact
central
booking
and
local
prosecutors
rejected
more
than
charges
between
and
how
often
are
police
stopping
or
arresting
people
for
violations
or
for
no
reason
at
a
stretch
from

police

more
than

the
report
doubts
that
figure
noting
that
stops
are
one
area
where
cops
consistently
failed
to
document
their
actions

our
investigation
suggests
that
officers
likely
make
several
hundred
thousand
pedestrian
stops
per
year
in
a
city
with
only

conducted
this

invasive

despite
lacking
any

had

the

the

another
case
a
teenage
boy
reported
that
an
officer
pulled
down
the
teenagers
pants
and
boxer
shorts
and
him
in
full
view
of
the
street
and
his
girlfriend
filed
a
complaint
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
teenager
recounted
to
us
that
shortly
after
filing
the
complaint
the
same
officer
approached
him
near
a
restaurant
in
his
neighborhood
pushed
the
teenager
against
a
wall
pulled
down
his
pants
and
grabbed
his
genitals
officer
filed
no

which
the

believes
was
done
in
retaliation
for
filing
a
complaint
about
the
first
strip
of
evinced
an
appalling
attitude
toward
alleged
victims
of
sexual
assaults
the
report
found
based
on
conversations
with
victims
and
advocates
as
well
as
documents
engaged
in
and
tried
to
discourage
pressing
of
charges
and
detectives
in
often
question
victims
in
a
manner
that
puts
the
blame
for
the
sexual
assault
on
the
victims
example
with
questions
suggesting
the
victims
should
feel
personally
responsible
for
the
potential
consequences
of
a
criminal
report
on
a
suspect
or
for
having
engaged
in
behavior
that
invited
the
assault
their
interviews
of
women
reporting
sexual
assault
for
example
detectives
ask
questions
such
as
are
you
messing
that
guys
life
officers
and
detectives
also
asked
questions
suggesting
that
they
discredit
the
reports
of
victims
who
delayed
in
reporting
the
assault
to
the
advocate
reported
hearing
a
detective
in
the
say
that
all
of
our
cases
are
and
have
these
practices
been
allowed
to
flourish
within
the
potential
explanation
is
that
has
effectively
cut
off
any
route
for
the
airing
of
grievances
either
from
the
public
or
from
discourages
members
of
the
public
from
filing
complaints
against
officers
through
the
procedural
requirements
has
imposed
on
filing
complaints
and
officers
and
supervisors
have
actively
discouraged
community
members
from
filing
complaints
the
report
states
people
do
make
it
over
those
hurdles
investigators
frequently
misclassify
those
complaints
or
administratively
close
them
with
little
attempt
to
contact
the
who
might
serve
as
are
discouraged
from
doing
so
by
the
threat
of
retaliation
officers
who
had
complained
told
the
they
believed
they
had
been
targeted

egregious

worth

two

this
misconduct

that
after
reporting
the
incident
to
prosecutors
fellow

frequently
called
him
a

sergeant
left
pictures
of

on
the

desk
detective
also
told
us
that
a
lieutenant
denied
his
transfer
request
to
a
violent
repeat
offender
squad
because
the
detective
snitched
lieutenant
allegedly
said
that
the
detective
was
not
the
right
fit
for
the
unit
because
they
have
to
do
things
in
the
gray
area
on
two
occasions
no
one
in
the
detectives
unit
responded
to
his
calls
for
backup
retaliation
intensified
as
the
officers

approached
the
detective

a
dead
rat
on

car
with
its

the

to
two
realities
about
prosecuting

cases
one
national
and

it
underscores
the
difficulty
of
prosecuting
police
relatively
few
officers
are
charged
with
crimes
in
cases
where
civilians
are
killed
and
even
fewer
are
convicted
attorneys
are
reluctant
to
bring
charges
against
police
because
they
depend
on
them
for
testimony
in
other
cases
and
juries
tend
to
be
deferential

overreach

their

putting

prosecutors
were
unable
to
produce
the
evidence
they
needed
to
show
that
police
had
intentionally
hurt
or
had
even
been
negligent
they
argued
in

that

that

intentionally
banged
him
around
in
the
implausible

scolded
them

incendiary
allegations

parts
of
their

relied
on
novel
legal
theories
charging
police
for
behavior
that
while
perhaps
distasteful
has
seldom
or
never

apparently
recognized
that
they
were
going
nowhere

particularly
sharp
challenges

criticism

some
calls

an
inherent
bias

police
themselves

accused
police

of
sabotaging
her

officers
who

witnesses

tough
questions

uncooperative

clear
what

she
did
not

civil

against

the
trials
are
perhaps
not
a
total
loss
a
law
professor
at

of
told
me
in
that
the
trials
had
done
an
important
service
in
putting
allegations
of
brutality
into
the
public
record
even
where
there
wasnt
evidence
to
have
ample
evidence
that
rough
rides
are
occurring
even
if
there
wasnt
a
rough
ride
in
this
case
have
the
states
attorney
acknowledging
for
the
first
time
that
police
routinely
grab
people
on
the
street
throw
them
up
against
the
wall
without
probable
cause
and
search
them
he
said
are
we
going
to
stop
this
egregious
the
answer
was
that
police
reform
requires
a
broader
effort
not
one
that
relies
on
the
system
to
change
behavior
around
the
margins

that
theyre
giving

a

in
the
the

few
years
all
the
tips
that

have
not
led
to
anything
new
she

piece
of
physical

we

looked
at

we

waiting
for
evidence
to
come
back
from
the
lab
in

came
back
in
and
there
was
no
physical
match
to
the
person
we
were
looking
at
whom
we
thought
might
be
a
match
for
she
has
long
seemed
likely
that
mystery
would
remain
just
that
but
the
announcement
marks
a
more
formal
surrender
story
was
all
the
more
alluring
for
the
tantalizing
clues
that
have
emerged
over
the
years
one
even
knows
for
sure
who
was
bought
his
plane
ticket
as
but
who
he
really
was
and
or
what
he
was
really
named
remain
subject
to
intense
speculation
but
unknown
became
popularly
known
as
after
the
interviewed
and
then
cleared
a
reporter
named
contends
that
probably
died
in
his
didnt
survive
his
jump
from
the
plane
all
the
parachute
he
used
couldnt
be
steered
his
clothing
and
footwear
were
unsuitable
for
a
rough
landing
and
he
had
jumped
into
a
wooded
area
at
dangerous
proposition
for
a
seasoned
pro
which
evidence
suggests
was
a
boy
found
a
package
of
nearly

whose
serial
numbers
matched
the
ransom
money
rest
of
the
money
or
any
sign
of

not

anywhere
nearby
of
course
they
would
want
us
to
believe
that
was
dead
and
not
that
theyd
let
him
slip
away
news
reports
told
of
a
new
suspect
one
who
had
gotten
away
with
the
crime
but
had
been
dead
for
years
reportedly
hoped
to
nab
with
the
help
of
saliva
left
on
the
cigarette
butts
only
problem
was
that
the
butts
had
gone
missing
just
another
bizarre
disappearance
in
the
decision
to
close
the
case
will
come
as
a
relief
to
some
attendants
and
the
pilots
are
pretty
sick
of
it
said
then
there
are
the

police
officers
were

in

one
of
the
deadliest
days
for

in

outside

killings
werent
the
first
time
officers
were
deliberately
targeted
the

four

four
officers
in

sat
over
their

of
these
killings
police
departments
across
the
country
asked
what
could
have
been
done
differently
to
protect
officers
it
was
one
day
in
when
four
officers
were
killed
that
had
the
most
impact
on
that
question
incident
is
known
as
the
named
for
the

where
two

four

about
an

its
officers
to
be
more
cautious

it
trained
police
in
tactics
that
reflected
this
new
attitude
deaths
of
police
officers
have
dropped
steadily
since
the
s
in
large
part
because
of

a
former
police
officer
who
served
years
in
the
metro
area
wrote
a
book
on
police
safety
and

lessons

revolvers
which
hold
six
bullets
with
and
small
arsenal
on
the
back
seat
six
shots
were
not
enough
one
development
after
the
shooting
was
the
adoption
of
more
powerful
weapons
by
police
and
the
provision
of
better
training
in
the
use
of
those
weapons
had
always
learned

shoot
by
aiming
at
stationary
targets

acknowledges
its
easy
to
look
back
and
point
out
the
many
things
the
officers
did
wrong
in
a
stop
officers
train
to
take
cover
behind

wait

backup
that
can
overwhelm

one
from

likewise
the

efforts
to
keep
officers
safe
through
more
weapons

more
defensive
training
appears
to
collide
these
days
with
what
and
other
activists
have
the
militarization

came

a

frankly
think
its
a
disgrace

she
should
apologize
to

because
of
a

of
the
use
of
a
robot
raises
questions
about
the
way
police
adopt
and
use
new
technologies
many
police
forces
have
adopted
more
accurately
uses
like
bomb
detonation
or
delivery
of
force
like
tear
gas
using
one
to
kill
a
suspect
is
at
least
highly
unusual
and
quite
possibly
not
aware
of
officers
using
a
device
as
a
delivery
mechanism
for
lethal
force
said
an
assistant
professor
of
law
at
the
of
who
is
a
former
police
officer
and
expert
on
police
methods
is
sort
of
a
new
horizon
for
police
technology
have
been
around
for
a
while
but
using
them
to
deliver
lethal
force
raises
some
new
expert
of
also
told
the
he
believed
the
use
was
while
there
are
likely
to
be
intense
ethical
debates
about
when
and
how
police
deploy
robots
in
this
manner
said
he
doesnt
think
decision
is
particularly
novel
from
a
legal
perspective
there
was
an
imminent
threat
to
officers
the
decision
to
use
lethal
force
was
likely
reasonable
while
the
weapon
used
was
circumstances
that
justify
lethal
force
justify
lethal
force
in
essentially
every
form
he
said
someone
is
shooting
at
the
police
the
police
are
generally
speaking
going
to
be
authorized
to
eliminate
that
threat
by
shooting
them
or
by
stabbing
them
with
a
knife
or
by
running
them
over
with
a
vehicle
lethal
force
is
justified
and
appropriate
the
method
of
doubt
its
legally
forces
have
adopted
devices
for
a
wide
variety
of
tasks
in
recent
years
from
tiny
to
large
tools

search
for
bombs

something
that
is
intended

as
a
explosive
of
devices
by
law
enforcement
raises
a
range
of
possible
questions
about
when
and
where
they
are
appropriate
advent
of
new
police
technologies
from
the
firearm
to
the
has
often
resulted
in
accusations
of
inappropriate
use
and
recalibration
in
when
police
use
them
pointed
out
that
prior
to
the
decision
in
v
the
rule
gave
officers
the
right
to
use
lethal
force
to
prevent
a
suspect
in
a
serious
crime
from
escaping
the
justices
limited
the
rule
saying
that
firearms
meant
the
rule
was
no
longer
current
either
they
or
civilians
are
in
danger
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
police
can
only
use
force
to
stop
a
fleeing
felon
the
adoption
of
the
has
raised
questions
about
whether
officers
are
too
quick
to
use
the
devices
when
they
would
be
better
served
to
deescalate
or
use
their
think
we
will
see
similar
concerns
when
were
talking
about
the
use
of
robots
to
employ
lethal
force
said
example
in
the
police
appear
to
have
faced
danger
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
imagine
a
scenario
in
which
a
suspect
has
been
shooting
but
is
not
currently
firing
and
in
which
all
officers
are
safely
covered
such
a
case
police
would
likely
not
open
up
a
gun
battle
would
commanders
be
quicker
to
deploy
a
robot
since
there
would
be
less
danger
to
would
current
rules
really
justify
is
reason
to
believe
they
would
nascent
questions
over
police
use
of
devices
echoes
an
existing
argument
over
the
military
use
of
such
tools
drone
strikes
overseas
are
believed
to
have
killed
hundreds
of
civilians
and
the
legal
justifications
for
when
and
where
they
are
used
are
often
hotly
contested
some
cases
drone
strikes
have
killed
citizens
without
due
process
civil
libertarians
are
troubled
by
the
implications
for
stateside
use
a
mounted
a
filibuster
blocking
the
confirmation
nominee
to
direct
the
over
the
refusal
to
say
whether
it
believed
it
could
use
military
drones
to
kill
suspects
on
soil
later
wrote
to
say
that
the
president
does
not
have
the
authority
to
do
away
from
the
realm
of
devices
into
the
world
of
autonomous
or
partially
autonomous
robots
that
could
deliver
lethal
or
even
force
and
the
concerns
mount
already
a
heated
debate
over
whether
and
how
the
military
should
deploy
lethal
autonomous
robots
debate
too
could
transfer
to
police
forces
as
noted
law
enforcement
serves
a
different
purpose
than
the
military
has
many
missions
but
at
its
core
is
about
dominating
and
eliminating
an
enemy
he
said
has
a
different
protecting
the
populace
core
mission
as
difficult
as
it
is
to
explains
sometimes
includes
protecting
some
people
who
do
some
bad
things
includes

using
lethal

right
theres
more
work
to
be
done
in
the
of
the

thats
been
really
interesting
is
realizing
that
so
many
people
think
that
were
done
that
weve
got
all
the
rights
we
need
now
that
we
can
marry
one
another
said
in
a
recent
interview
of
course
thats
not
true
its
actually
sort
of
distorting
to
have
marriage
in
states
where
you
can
be
kicked
out
of
your
home
where
you
can
be
refused
service
where
you
might
be

your
choice

where
you
could
lose
your

harshest
charges

the
severity
still
surprised
many
observers
is
charged

murder
in

case
that
on
its

seems
more
like
negligence

murder
says
that

such
wanton
and
reckless
disregard

it
amounts
to
malice
a
law
professor
at

told
me
at

of
the

approach

prosecutors
had
failed
to
substantiate
their
the
trier
of
fact
the
court
cannot
simply
let
things
speak
for
themselves
said
that
because
injuries
were
internal
a
professional
would
have
been
unable
to
gauge
order
to
prove
that
charge
prosecutors
argued
that
had
been
giving
a
rough
ride
a
form
of
punishment
in
which
police
drive
vans
erratically
turning
sharply
or
braking
suddenly
to
throw
prisoners
in
transit
around
had
been
suspicions
of
a
rough
ride
since
death
because
the
was
placed
in
a
van
while
apparently
healthy
but
less
than
an
hour
later
was
found
with
a
nearly
severed
spinal
cord
spent
a
week
in
a
coma
before
succumbing
to
his
injuries
prosecutors
did
not
seek
to
prove
the
rough
ride
until
trial
was
not
in
dispute
was
that
the
shackled
was
not
in
the
van
which
is
contrary
to
department
policy
but
nonetheless
common
according

the
rough

argument
and
upbraided

for
using
an
inflammatory
term

off

their

challenged
the

saying
the

included

that

more

they
argued
the

my
colleague
has
reported
five
years
after
landmark
v
in
and
v
in
the
is
avoiding
any
cases
about
the
the
justices
had
accepted
one
or
two
cases
or
their
silence
was
limited
to
a
single
term
or
two
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
speculate
a
silence
on
the
amid
a
number
of
major
cases
suggests
something
deeper
is
at
work
its
the
mass
shootings
the
rise
in
shootings
in
since
they
struck
down
the
handgun
ban
maybe
theyre
waiting
for
more
consensus
to
emerge
among
the
federal
circuit
courts
before
revisiting
the
questions
maybe
theyre
just
waiting
for
the
right
one
this
month
the
public
learned
about
a
case
in
through
the
words
of
the
people
involved
statements
made
in
court
that
were
widely
published
online
they
heard
from
the
victim
a
woman
whose
name
has
not
been
released
who
has
no
memory
of
the
assault
and
described
in
excruciating
detail
how
its
aftermath
robbed
her
of
my
worth
my
privacy
my
energy
my
time
my
safety
my
intimacy
my
confidence
my
own
voice
heard
from
the
offender
a
freshman
at
the
time
who
said
the
woman
had
consented
to
his
sexual
advances
and
blamed
the
party
culture
and
behavior
of
college
for
his
actions
heard
from
father
who
pleaded
with
the
judge
for
leniency
after
his
son
was
convicted
in
referring
to
the
crimes
as
minutes
of
now
they
can
hear
from
the
judge
in
the
case
of
the
who
determined
the
sentence
for
that
would
transform
a
local
case
into
a
point
of
national
debate
about
sexual
assault
male
and
class
privilege
and
the
criminal
justice
system
was
convicted
by
a
unanimous
jury

his
six
months
in
county
jail
and
three
years
of
less
than
the
six
years
prosecutors
had
asked
for
in
line
with
the
minimum
guideline
for
each
of
the
three
felony

published
a
full
transcript
it
from
sentencing
hearing
earlier
this
month
in
which
explains
his
reasoning
for
the
sentence
main
believed
side
of
the
story
that
the
victim
gave
consent
to
have
sexual
contact
with
mean
take
him
at
his
word
that
subjectively
thats
his
version
of
said
jury
obviously
found
it
not
to
be
the
sequence
of
said
determining
the
sentence
was
a
difficult
decision
said
he
considered
denying
probation
because
of
the
physical
and
devastating
emotional
injury
of
the

into
consideration
among
other
factors

not
previously

of
any

was
young
was
not
armed
during
the
crime
that
he
would
comply
with
the
terms
of
probation
and
he
would
not
be
a
danger
to
others
if
not
imprisoned
said
the
role
alcohol
played
in
the
assault
is
not
an
excuse
but
is
a
factor
that
when
trying
to
assess
moral
culpability
in
this
situation
is
mitigating

a
prison
sentence
would
have
a

account

for
the

of
his

a
sentence
of
six
could
be
reduced
to

for
good

advocates
pointed
to
the
case
as
a
prime
example
for
why
so
many
women
choose
not
to
report
sexual
assaults
to
police
or
press
charges
against
their
rapists
and
testify
against
them
attributed
the
judges
leniency
to

and
a

swimmer
with
potential
didnt
look
like
a

was
much
debate
whether
the
crimes
committed
amounted
to
rape
with
a
capital
the
legal
definition
of
rape
varies
by
state
in
it
is
defined
as
an
act
of
sexual
intercourse
including
sexual
penetration
no
matter
how
slight
under
several
circumstances
including
where
a
person
is
prevented
from
resisting
by
any
intoxicating
or
anesthetic
substance
or
any
controlled
substance
and
this
condition
was
known
or
reasonably
should
have
been
known
by
the
accused
goes
even
further
defining
rape
as
the
penetration
no
matter
how
slight
of
the
vagina
or
anus
with
any
body
part
or
object
or
oral
penetration
by

you
know
that
its
not
a
show
any
more

you
gotta
do
what

radicalization
by
this
killer
and
a
potential
of
inspiration
by
foreign
terrorist
organizations
purposely
did
not
use
name
throughout
his
remarks
saying
part
of
what
motivates
sick
people
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
is
some
twisted
notion
of
fame
or
glory
and
dont
want
to
be
part
of
that
for
the
sake
of
the
victims
and
their
families
and
so
that
other
twisted
minds
dont
think
that
this
is
a
path
to
fame
and
said
investigators
are
examining
electronic
devices
said
there
is
no
indication
so
far
that
received
instruction
from
abroad
or
was
part
of
a
terrorist
network
was
radicalized
and
at
least
in
some
part
through
the
internet
are
working
to
understand
what
role
bigotry
played
in
motivating
this
attack
he
are
looking
for
needles
in
a
nationwide
haystack
said
were
also
called
upon
to
figure
out
which
pieces
of
hay
that
someday
become
said
first
came
to
the
attention
of
in
when
he
worked
as
a
security
guard
at
a
local
courthouse
had
told
his
coworkers
he
was
a
member
of
terrorist
group
his
family
had
ties
to
and
he
told
coworkers
that
he
hoped
law
enforcement
would
raid
his
apartment
and
assault
his
wife
and
child
so
he
could
martyr
himself
spent
months
investigating
him
which
including
interviewing
him
twice
following
him
recording
his
conversations
with
informants
and
his
communications
said
he
made
those
remarks
because
he
felt
his
coworkers
were
discriminating
against
him
for
being
and
the
investigation
was
looked
into
him
again
in
of
when
they
learned
and
the
suicide
bomber
who
died
in
attended
the
same
mosque
in
also
gave
more
details
of
the
phone
calls
the
shooter
made
to
dispatchers
during
attack
dialed
twice
dispatcher
called
him
back
after
that
and
then
pledged
loyalty
to
the
leader
of
and
expressed
solidarity
with
the
bombers
of
the
and
an
citizen
who
carried
out
a
suicide
bombing
in
in
am
says
it
appears
was
radicalized
by
extremist
propaganda
disseminated
on
the
an
excerpt
from
his
remarks
at
the
made
after
he
received
a
security
still
at
the
preliminary
stages
of
the
investigation
and
theres
a
lot
more
that
we
have
to
learn
one
thing
that
we
can
say
is
that
this
is
being
treated
as
a
terrorist
investigation
appears
that
the
shooter
was
inspired
by
various
extremist
information
that
was
disseminated
on
the
those
materials
are
currently
being
searched
exploited
so
we
can
have
a
better
sense
of
the
pathway
that
the
killer
took
in
making
a
decision
to
launch
this
attack
this
stage
we
see
no
clear
evidence
that
he
was
directed
externally
does
appear
that
at
the
last
minute
he
pronounced
allegiance
to
but
theres
no
evidence
so
far
that
he
was
in
fact
directed
by
and
there
are
also
at
this
stage
no
direct
evidence
that
he
was
part
of
a
larger
plot
that
sense
it
appears
to
be
similar
to
what
we
saw
in

dont

the

the

experts
almost
immediately
declared
it
the
deadliest

in

surpassing
the
shooting
in
that
left
people
was
this
actually
the
deadliest
mass
shooting
in
short
yes
but
it
depends
on
how
a
mass
shooting
is
defined
definition
has
been
the
subject
of
some
the
aftermath
of
the
shooting
some
publications
called
the
in
the
deadliest
shooting
in
history
as
many
of
mostly
men
women
and
children
were
killed
at
the

of
the

remains
one
of

the
of
that
were
given
to
members
of

for
their
participation
in
the
skirmish
have
yet
to
be
rescinded
was
it
the
deadliest

could
even
argue
the
deadliest
shooting
in
a
event
in
the
was
at
the
of
during
the
in
in
which
people
these
two
and
military
operations
and
would
not
qualify
as
mass
shootings
as
most
experts
define
we
talk
about
mass
killing
we
talk
about
it
as
criminal
homicide
a
criminology
professor
at
tells
me
generally
killing
related
to
military
operations
wartime
etc
is
not
criminal
homicide
homicide
but
not
criminal
there
are
times
when
troops
kill
civilians
and
are
prosecuted
for
it
like
in
the
during
the
the
actions
are
still
part
of
war
murder
argues
has
criminal
intent
not
related
to
the
these
mass
shootings
or
killings
be
any
less
serious
or
tragic
if
they
werent
the
there
is
no
one
definition
of
a
mass
shooting
defines
it
as
three
or
more
people
killed
by
a
shooter
in
a
single
event
bureau
used
to
define
mass
shootings
as
the
killing
of
four
or
more
people
but
changed
the
designation
in

in
its
database
documents
instances
in
which
at

four
people
were
killed
in

in

that

not
involve

violence

also
includes

with
four
or
more
victims

a

more

told
in

the

is
to
stop
minimizing
these
acts
of

media
outlets
have
picked
up
on
this
tracker
and
accepted
its
definition
how
could
say
the
was
averaging
one
mass
shooting
a
day
at
one
point
last
even
the
professor
has
his
own
definition
views
mass
shootings
as
when
four
or
more
people
are
killed
in
a
single
incident
also
argues
that
the
index
leads
to
mass
confusion
since
the
vast
majority
of
events
on
the
tracker
do
not
involve
deaths
which
he
says
paints
a
false
picture
of
gun
violence
in
the
of
the
databases
were
created
in
when
many
mass
to
to
widespread
media
coverage
the
term
mass
shootings
has
been
in
our
vernacular
since
most
notably
the
s
readers
have
shared
their
theories
for
why
that
is
to
my
colleague
what
we
now
call
mass
shootings
have
occurred
for
decades
even
if
we
didnt
track
those
incidents
the
way
we
do
dont
have
the
historical
context
to
determine
whether
or
not
mass
shootings
whatever
the
definition
may
be
are
on
the
there
are
likely
hundreds
of
mass
shootings
that
were
simply
not
counted
is
clear
is
that
mass
killing
in
different
forms
whether
through
guns
arson
or
bombings
have
been
part
of
shooting
is
not
the
biggest
mass
killing
in
history
title
would
go
to
the
bombing
in
where
people
died
attacks
would
not
qualify
since
it
was
an
act
of
international
terrorism
despite
the
deaths
of
people
not
including
the
the
attack
in
may
be
the
deadliest
mass
shooting
in
history
but
other
shootings
were
deadliest
for
specific
locations
shooting
at
for
example
where
people
were
killed
is
the
deadliest
mass
shooting
in
a
high
school
or
grade

in
history
that

just
past

rubbed
off
as

from

clearness

freshness
of
the
rocky

that
the
natural
wonders
of
the
country

succumb
to
the
commercial
demand
for
lumber
this
made
the
creation
of
national
parks
an
urgent

that
he
once
climbed
a
pine
during
a
particularly
bad
storm
just
to
see
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
tree
in
heavy
winds
the

he
described

in
exhaustive
detail
including
its
sugar

not

was
past

of
his
final
observations
of
the
national
park
for
came
during
the
issue
when
he
excitedly
described
waterways
recounted
one
specific
location
in
the
park
of
which
he
was
particularly
north
fork
of
he
says
had
wonderful
champagne
water
that
was
best
imbibed
by
leaning
down
and
drinking
directly
from
its
source
lest
the
touch
of
a
cup
might
disturb
its
celestial
story
from
that
essay
captures
the
joy
found
one
morning
about
two
was
aroused
by
an
and
though
had
never
before
enjoyed
a
storm
of
this
sort
the
strange
wild
thrilling
motion
and
rumbling
could
not
be
mistaken
and
ran
out
of
my
cabin
near
the
both
glad
and
frightened
shouting
noble
feeling
sure
was
going
to
learn
boulder
soon
gave
way
up
the
valley
tumbling
down
leveling
trees
and
breaking
into
piece
the
dust
settled
and
the
chaos
calmed
he
usually
so
deliberate
in
her
operations
then
created
as
we
have
seen
a
new
of
features
simply
by
giving
the
mountains
a
not
only
the
high
peaks
and
cliffs
but
the
streams
soon
as
these
rock
avalanches
fell
every
stream
began
to
sing
new
for
in
many
places
thousands
of
boulders
were
hurled
into
their
channels
roughening
and
half
damming
them
compelling
the
waters
to
surge
and
roar
in
rapids
where
before
they
were
gliding
smoothly
of
the
streams
were
completely
dammed
driftwood
leaves
etc
filling
the
interstices
between
the
boulders
thus
giving
rise
to
lakes
and
level
and
these
again
after
being
gradually
filled
in
to
smooth
meadows
through
which
the
streams
now
silently
while
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
taluses
took
the
places
of
old
meadows
and
groves
rough
places
were
made
smooth
and
smooth
places
rough
on
the
whole
by
what
at
first
sight
seemed
pure
confusion
and
ruin
the
landscapes
were
for
gradually
every
talus
however
big
the
boulders
composing
it
was
covered
with
groves
and
gardens
and
made
a
finely
proportioned
and
ornamental
base
for
the
sheer
cliffs
this
beauty
work
every
boulder
is
prepared
and
measured
and
put
in
its
place
more
thoughtfully
than
are
the
stones
of
his
writings
he
explored
nature
with
such
reverence
that
the
trees
insects
and
animals
became
characters
wanted
visitors
of
to
appreciate
their
surroundings
as
much
as
he
did
became
clear
in
the
issue
when
he
in
the
forests
usually
complain
of
the
want
of
life
trees
they
say
are
fine
but
the
empty
stillness
is
there
are
no
animals
to
be

no
birds

not
heard
a
song
in
all
the
woods
no

started
at
am
tracked
a
scent
from
the
house
where
the
killings
occurred
to
a
vacant
the
street
was
searching
that
area
when
who
lived
a
couple
blocks
away
came
by
discrepancy
about
what
happened
next
but
in
a
report
by
a
former
police
detective
who
reinvestigated
the
case
for
on
of
said
approached
knew
what
was
investigating
there
first
questioned
who
then
said
he
didnt
want
to
help
anyway
it
turned
out
was
related
to
a
former
homicide
detective
whom
one
of
knew
called
the
truthful
knew
about
the
suspects
said
hed
seen
people
with
guns
run
through
his
yard
and
knew
them
as
part
of
a
local
the
officers
wanted
he
could
point
out
where
about
two
hours
the
officers
drove
the
teenager
through
in
an
unmarked
police
car
to
the
crime
scene
no
record
of
what
happened
in
that
time
but
by
am
theyd
come
to
the
police
an
interrogation
his
typed
confession
prepared
read
that
admitted
he
and
three
friends
planned
to
rob
the
house
on
first
met
at
a
restaurant
then
passed
outguns
the
drive
to
the
house
according
first
confession
to
get
out
of
the
car
before
they
reached
the
house
on
then
home
was
he
said
his
friend
jumped
through
the
backyard
and
that
hed
shot
officers
let
and
in
the
following
days
police
visited
the
friends
named
story
restaurant
he
claimed
to
have
met
at
had
been
closed
for
didnt
match
any
of
the
descriptions
given
by
witnesses
who
saw
the
and
the
caliber
of
guns
described
were
wrong
two
subsequent
confessions
were
closer
to
what
the
police
next
day
police
picked
up
again
and
interrogated
him
second
session
was
not
recorded
evidence
of
what
happened
is
a
final
statement
the
officer
typed
time
said
he
and
three
friends
met
at
a
park
a
and
his
description
of
the
guns
matched
those
used
in
the
killings
third
interrogation
he
said
two
friends
drove
away
in
a
van
different
in
the
first
and
and
that
an
away
from
the
account
that
would
match
what
witnesses
said
they
officers
would
say
where
the
bodies
lay
in
the
house
something
only
the
way
the
interrogation
process
is
set
up
in
this
country
is
that
not
to
get
information
from
you
but
to
get
a
confessions
the
former
detective
told
me
only
supposed
to
interrogate
people
guilty
supposed
to
ask
you
things
as
if
without
a
doubt
in
my
mind
you
are
years
ago
in
wrote
an
article
that
an
innocent
person
under
interrogation
can
willfully
admit
to
a
crime
didnt
commit
interrogations
are
high
pressure
officer
might
ask
questions
get
wrong
answers
but
what
counts
is
the
one
thats
police
can
lie
can
tell
a
suspect
they
have
their
fingerprints
or
witnesses
putting
them
at
the
crime
scene
or
that
to
put
suspects
on
the
defensive
and
get
them
to
reveal
details
about
the
crime
that
no
one
but
would
know
this
second
approach
involves
officers
letting
important
details
slip
or
details
known
only
to
the
police
and
the
suspect
in
this
case
under
a
barrage
of
questioning
feels
compelled
to
confess
to
a
crime
he
didnt
we
create
where
you
are
faced
with
what
you
perceive
to
be
an
inevitable
consequence
said
placing
himself
in
the
suspects
telling
me
all
this
evidence
and
they
have
these
witnesses
telling
me
going
tobe
found
guilty
no
matter
what
screwed
hes
also
telling
me
that
if
hes
going
to
go
home
this
will
go
away
need
to
tell
him
what
he
wants
to
was
a
false
confession
owes
to
his
current
path
of
educating
officers
on
correct
interrogation
techniques
he
worked
a
case
where
someone
had
been
bound
beaten
to
death
then
dumped
in
main
suspect
was
a
homeless
woman
who
confessed
after
a
interrogation
later
dropped
the
charges
because
it
couldnt
have
been
her
why
then
she
he
listened
to
the
recording
of
the
heard
himself
accidentally
pointing
her
toward
answers
revealing
information
only
the
have
known
she
parroted
this
back
in
conversation
it
seemed
like
she
must
be
the
was
so
blinded
he
said
officers
are
interrogation
is
supposed
to
elicit
a
confession
not
to
learn
about
the
about
it
told
convinced
that
youre
everything
that
you
say
everything
you
do
is
going
to
be
perceived
through
that
lens
about
the
way
the
interrogation
process
is
already
determined
the
truth
before
in
what
trying
to
do
is
verify
the
way
perceive
things
to
what
the
truth
the
woman
was
asked
why
to
a
crime
she
didnt
commit
hours
she
said
was
tired
figured
give
them
something
and
maybe
let
me
go
also
spoke
with
a
at
on
of
at
who
said
its
uncanny
how
similar
victims
of
false
confession
sound
some
point
they
just
break
down
and
want
to
case
he
seemed
to
have
little
concept
of
to
murder
the
reporter
sitting
in
the
interrogation
room
thinking
he
should
just
do
what
the
officer
wanted
everything
to
be
right
he
if
it
wasnt
right
he
wasnt
going
to
believe
me
and
he
would
keep
me

wanted
to
go

after

to
up
to

to

a

he

left

three

afterward
people

she
watching

the
zoo
there
no
other
people
have
asked
why
a
zoo
full
of
dangerous
or
dangerous
animals
is
even
necessary
might
be
because
calling
for
an
end
to
zoos
has
typically
been
the
cause
of
poets
and
activists
past
arguments
against
zoos
have
focused
on
the
insensitivity
toward
animals
wrote
two
years
ago
in
a
piece
for
magazine
titled
for
the
of
the
realize
that
to
even
raise
this
issue
makes
you
sound
like
some
kind
of
sour
vegetarian
so
let
me
make
clear
my
position
up
love
zoos
daughter
is
not
quite
and
the
zoo
brings
out
all
of
her
best
and
least
complicated
emotions
awe
delight
concern
for
caged
animals
has
caught
enough
mainstream
interest
that
and
introduced
bills
that
would
outlaw
killer
whales
kept
in
captivity
focus
on
killer
whales
is
in
large
part
owed
to
a
documentary
called
but
it
proves
that
it
has
become
a
concern
for
more
than
a
fringe
of
advocates
much
so
that
last
said
it
would
stop
breeding
captive
killer
whales
if
keeping
an
orca
in
large
tank
is
unethical
then
why
not
an
elephant
a
tiger
or
a
western
lowland
argument
for
zoos
is
often
that
they
serve
to
educate
the
public
they
give
people
who
cant
afford
to
travel
a
chance
to
see
the
animals
and
that
zoos
serve
as
important
conservation
is
a
distinction
of
course
between
good
zoos
and
bad
zoos
the
s
a
study
of
animals
at
the
found
some
had
died
from
frequent
tranquilizing
malnutrition
and
that
some
had
suffered
repeated
injuries
while
being
transported
that
report
and
with
a
rise
in
scientists
who
study
animal
behavior
zoos
have
tried
to
improve
conditions
for
their
caged
animals
was
partly
the
cause
for
more
the
gorilla
exhibit
in
empty
boring
barren
enclosures
can
cause
depression
or
aggression
in
some
animals
including
primates
according
to
a
study
by
in
that
regard
the
is
by
all
means
a
good
zoo
providing
a
relatively
comfortable
enclosure
not
simple
to
accommodate
the
worlds
largest
primate
are
as
strong
as
eight
men
they
can
be
aggressive
and
theyre
also
endangered
all
those
reason
theyre
fascinating
to
watch
unless
someone
planned
to
visit
the
forests
of
a
zoo
is
the
only
place
a
person
will
likely
see
for
that
matter
a
wolf
a
rhino
or
a
rhinoceros
hornbill
bird
kept
at
the
course
theres
but
that
really
does
pale
next
to
seeing
a
living
creature
in
the
flesh
hearing
it
smelling
it
watching
what
it
does
and
having
the
time
to
absorb
details
wrote
a
paleontologist
and
writer
who
has
defended
zoos
teach
do
a
sociologist
at
the
of
published
a
study
in
the
journal
that
surveyed
children
before
and
after
a
zoo
visit
and
found
only
had
a
positive
learning
experience
meaning
theyd
learned
something
factual
percent
of
the
kids
picked
up
incorrect
information
perhaps
what
people
mean
and
more
in
line
with
what
argued
in
his
article
was
that
zoos
are
a
type
of
consciousness
expander
expose
people
young
and
old
to
something
theyd
never
otherwise
be
able
to
see
example
a
parents
may
take
her
to
the
and
years
afterward
she
might
remember
that
moment
and
dream
of
a
job
working
alongside
achieve
that
children
are
not
the
only
group
to
learn
from
zoos
visit
them
observe
and
study
the
animals
and
help
animal
conservation
this
case
zoos
act
like
temples
of

human
intervention
inside
protects
a
species
from
human
threats
outside

to
the

hundreds
of

true
zoos
have
played
a
massive
role
in
conserving
and
in
the
recovery
of
some
species
but
this
is
a
relatively
small
portion
of
the
animals
zoos
work
with
pointed
out
in
an
article
for

that
of
all
the

the

but
never

they

have
changed
